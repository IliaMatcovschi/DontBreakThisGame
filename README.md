# DontBreakThisGame
2D action game created with Unity for Brackeys Game Jam 2025 in one week

## Description
This is a decision-based game where your choices about items can break the game.

You play as a forester who discovers a mysterious tool that allows him to throw saws. With it, he sets out to destroy the evil lumbermen invading the forest. Three types of enemies will try to defeat you using reflections and environment. To survive, you can jump over saws and trees, and fire bouncing saws to eliminate threats. But be careful â€” your own saws can hurt you if you're not cautious. Make the right choices, master your tools, and claim victory.
